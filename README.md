# Bad Apple!! in GTA V
This is my contribution to the 'Bad Apple, but it's played on ...' series, this time in GTA V. This repo acts as a resource for a FiveM FXServer. I would like to warn the reader that the code is all over the place and the implementation is extremely inefficient: it just loads every single pixel of the video in ram and then plays it.
